First project to learn Avalonia with hands on experience.

Using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm for the observable objects, observable property, and relay command attributes. 
Using Avalonia.Themes.Fluent, FluentAvaloniaUi, and NP.Ava.Visuals for different visuals and behaviors I wanted to see with this app.
